For example, if an assignment gets an on-time mark of $20/25$ and is submitted three days late, it will receive a mark reduction of $3*1.25 = 3.75$, so the assignment will get $16.25$ after three days.

You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as GitHub or file-sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private, and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",

        "## Task 1 [14 Marks] - Data preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Your first task is to preprocess the datasets. Preprocessing usually involves data cleaning and transformation to improve data quality and prepare the data for the specific requirements of the learning approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "For data preparation, we have the following tasks:\n",
        "1. **Missing imputation (all models)**: The adult dataset has missing values, and none of our learning algorithm implementations can directly handle missing data. Two missing data treatments are eliminating the rows with missing data or replacing the missing values with estimated ones. *Mean imputation*, as the name suggests, replaces missing values with the attribute mean, median (continuous features) or mode (discrete features). These statistics must only be estimated in the training set.\n",
        "2. **Feature encoding (all models)**: Neural networks, tree and random forest implementations available in the Scikit-Learn library do not handle categorical attributes directly. Therefore, these attributes need to be converted into numerical attributes. Although several encoding approaches exist, we will use one-hot encoding, as it is simple and recommended for categorical features with a small cardinality.\n",
        "3. **Class attribute encoding (neural networks only)**: Neural networks also need a one-hot encoding for the class attribute. This step is not necessary for the tree models.\n",
        "4. **Rescaling attribute values (neural networks only)**: The neural network's training benefits from rescaling the attribute values. In this task, we will convert each attribute to a number in the 0 to 1 range by using a simple linear rescaling: $x_s = \\frac{x-min_f}{max_f-min_f}$, where $x_s$ is the recalled $x$ value, $min_f$ is the minimum and $max_f$ the maximum values for feature $f$ in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tree models typically do not use class encoding and rescaling. The reason is twofold: first, this preprocessing does not help these models fit better parameters; second, tree models are known for their interpretability, and these manipulations create models that are not easier and often harder to understand. Feature encoding is also unnecessary for many tree model implementations, including the well-known [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Unfortunately, the Scikit-Learn implementation of tree models does not support categorical attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Warning**: Leaking information from the test set to the training set, even if such information is aggregated data such as means, maximums, and minimums, is considered a serious methodological error. For instance, mean imputation should use the mean only in the training set. Similarly, the maximum and minimum for attribute rescaling should be calculated in the training set. Consequently, we may see values outside the range of 0-1 in the rescaled test set. This mimics the situation in which we find extreme values after the model deployment."

Would you expect some models to be more efficient than others for inference? What is the importance of having efficient models for inference? What is the importance of having efficient models for training?\n",
